* Description
  The code in this repository is used in an art intallation by Amanda
  Dawn Christie.  The piece is a model of the 13 short wave emission
  towers that were in Sackville, NB.  The first version will be set on
  a small hill by the boardwalk of the Halifax Harbour.  Each tower
  has a speaker.  When a visitor touches (or ideally, approaches) one
  of the towers, the sound of that tower is played back.

* Technical overview
  Each tower has a Wifi module (ESP8266) and capacitive sensing chip
  (MPR121).
